# import os
# path = os.getcwd() # Path at terminal when executing this file

oldfilename = filename + ".txt"  # name for the file that will be created
newfilename = filename + ".csv"  # name for the file that will be created

file = open(oldfilename, "r")          # open's file for reading
soup = BeautifulSoup(file)             # passes contents to beautiful soup
file.close()                           # shuts the file
text = soup.get_text().encode("utf-8") # gets text only without html markups

f = open(newfilename, "w")      # creates a new file to dump the text
f.write( text )                 # puts text from beautiful soup in it
f.close()                       # saves the file
